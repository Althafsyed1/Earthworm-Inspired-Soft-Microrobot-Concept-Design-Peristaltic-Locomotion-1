# Earthworm-Inspired Soft Microrobot (Concept / Pre-Design)

Conceptual pre-design of an earthworm-inspired soft microrobot that uses **peristaltic locomotion** for confined-space navigation (biomedical + aerospace inspiration).

> Note: This repository contains a **concept design and engineering analysis**.  
> **No physical fabrication or experimental testing was performed** as part of this project.

## Overview
This project documents the proposed system architecture, component selection, sizing calculations, and an implementation-ready fabrication workflow for a soft, segmented microrobot inspired by earthworm locomotion.

Key Components (Concept)
- **Actuation:** SMA bimorph-based segment contraction for peristaltic motion  
- **Sensing:** 
  - Piezoresistive force sensing (bridge-based concept)
  - Capacitive proximity sensing (interdigitated concept)
- **Power:** Wireless power transfer concept and sizing calculations
- **Mechanical Packaging:** SolidWorks-based housing/integration concept (if included)

## What’s Included
- Full concept report (PDF) with assumptions, calculations, system work, flowFigures and diagrams
